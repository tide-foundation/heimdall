		in respect of the Materials and the Modified Materials. 
	  (b)	Any access, use, copy, modification, adaptation, distribution, 
		publication or exploitation of any of the Materials for use 
		with applications that do not fully use, adopt and implement 
		the Tide Protocol is prohibited. This prohibition includes any 
		use or adaptation of the Materials for the purposes of any 
		protocol, system or platform competing with the Tide Protocol 
		or which facilitates any form of payment or exchange of value 
		other than through use of Tide Tokens (as defined in paragraph 
		(c) below). 
	  (c)	Without limiting paragraph (b), the License granted under 
		paragraph (a) does not permit you to, and in exercising the 
		rights granted to you under paragraph (a) you must not, under 
		any circumstances:
		(i)	remove, omit or in any way modify any component of the 
			Materials, including source code components, which 
			requires payment or exchange of value to be made via 
			Tide cryptographic tokens designed for settling 
			transactions entered into via the Tide Protocol (“Tide 
			Tokens”); 
		(ii)	use the Materials which are source code or object code:
			(A)	in combination with any other code, script or 
				software (whether in source or object code form), 
				or otherwise in any manner, which would in any way 
				circumvent the requirement for any payment or 
				exchange of value to be made via Tide Tokens; or
			(B)	in any other way which does not properly use, adopt 
				and implement the Tide Protocol in its entirety, 
				including for the purposes of both data decryption 
				and key management;  
		(iii)	violate any applicable laws or any rights of any person, 
			or use or permit or facilitate the use of the Materials 
			in any manner or for any purpose that is unlawful or is 
			in breach of any laws of jurisdiction anywhere in the 
			world;
		(iv)	distribute viruses, spyware, corrupted files, or any 
			other similar software or programs that may damage the 
			operation of any computer hardware or software, or the 
			Tide Protocol; or
		(v)	engage in any other conduct that is improper or brings 
			or is likely to bring us, the Materials, the Tide 
			Protocol or Tide Tokens into disrepute,
		and you must ensure that where any third party is being engaged 
		to make modifications to the Materials on your behalf, their 
		rights to do so are subject to terms which incorporate the 
		restrictions in this clause 3.
	  (d)	You must take your own precautions to ensure that the processes 
		which you employ for accessing and using the Materials do not 
		expose you to the risk of viruses, malicious computer code or 
		other forms of interference which may damage your computer 
		systems.  We recommend that you install and use up-to-date 
		anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall software on your computer 
		systems.  

	4	Data security and privacy	
	  You are fully responsible for ensuring:
	  (a)	any use, adoption or implementation of the Materials, any 
		Modified Materials and/or the Tide Protocol appropriately 
		protects, encrypts and stores data; and 
	  (b)	all aspects of compliance with privacy and data protection laws. 
	  We disclaim all warranties and liability regarding the same.
	  
	5	Modification of Tide Protocol and Materials 
	  You acknowledge that Tide may at any time without notice to you change 
	  or update the whole or any part of the Tide Protocol and/or any of the 
	  Materials, including in a manner which may result in applications or 
	  processes you may have developed or implemented no longer being 
	  compatible or otherwise working in the same manner with the Tide 
	  Protocol or any Material, including any software development kit. We 
	  may also withdraw or remove any part of the Materials or the Tide 
	  Protocol at any stage without notice to you.

	6	Distribution 
	  (a)	Without limiting clause 3, in exercising the rights granted to 
		you under clause 3(a) to distribute or publish one or more 
		copies of any Materials verbatim as you receive the Materials,
		you may do so in any medium, provided that:
		(i)	you provide all recipients of the Materials with a copy of 
			these terms along with the Materials: 
		(ii)	you keep intact and do not remove, omit, or in any way 
			modify any of the following:
			(A)	any notices stating that these License terms apply; 
			(B)	any hyperlink to these License terms; and
			(C)	any notices of the absence of any warranty;
	  (b)	You may charge any price or no price for each copy of the 
		Materials or Modified Materials that you distribute or publish,
		and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
	  (c)	Without limiting clause 3, in exercising the rights granted to 
		you under clause 3(a) to distribute or publish one or more 
		copies of any Modified Materials you create or cause to be 
		created, you may do so in any medium, provided that:
		(i)	you provide all recipients of the Modified Materials with 
			a copy of these terms along with the Modified Materials; 
		(ii)	you keep intact and do not remove, omit, or in any way 
			modify any of the following:
			(A)	any notices stating that these License terms apply to 
				the unmodified Materials;
			(B)	any hyperlink to these License terms; and
			(C)	any notices of the absence of any warranty in respect 
				of the unmodified Materials; and
		(iii)	the whole of any Modified Materials must be licensed under 
			these terms (although this does not limit the operation of 
			paragraph (d)), but you may impose further restrictions 
			that do not conflict with or override these terms.
	  (d)	Where you compile any source code Materials or Modified 
		Materials in an aggregate with any proprietary program, the 
		Materials remain governed by these License terms. For the 
		purposes of the foregoing, a compilation of any Materials with 
		other separate and independent works, which are not by their 
		nature extensions of the Materials, and which are not combined 
		with the Materials such as to form a larger program, in or on 
		a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is an “aggregate” 
		if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to 
		limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users 
		beyond what the individual Materials permit. Inclusion of any 
		Materials in an aggregate does not cause these terms to apply 
		to the other parts of the aggregate.
	  (e)	You may not initiate any proceedings or claims in respect of 
		infringement of any patent rights in respect of the access, 
		use, copy, modification, adaptation, distribution, publication 
		or exploitation of any of the Materials or Modified Materials 
		in accordance with these terms.

	7	Liability
	  (a)	All express or implied guarantees, warranties, representations, 
		statements, terms or conditions relating to these terms or the 
		Materials that are not contained in these terms, are excluded 
		to the maximum extent permitted by law. Without limiting the 
		foregoing:
		(i)	the Materials are provided ‘as-is’ and neither we nor Tide 
			warrant or represent that they will work in any way, that 
			they are fit for any particular purpose, that your 
			requirements will be met, that your use of the Materials 
			will be uninterrupted or error free or that the Materials 
			are free of viruses or other harmful components; and
		(ii)	we and Tide are not responsible for any loss, corruption or 
			interception of data which occurs in connection with your 
			use or misuse of the Materials.
	  (b)	Nothing in these terms excludes, restricts or modifies any 
		guarantee, term, condition, warranty, or any right or remedy, 
		implied or imposed by any law which cannot lawfully be excluded 
		or limited. (a “Non-Excludable Provision”). If any guarantee, 
		term, condition or warranty is implied into these terms under a 
		Non-Excludable Provision and we or Tide can limit your remedy 
		for a breach of the Non-Excludable Provision, then our and 
		Tide’s liability for breach of the Non-Excludable Provision is 
		limited to one or more of the following at our option:
		(i)	in the case of goods, the replacement of the goods or the 
			supply of equivalent goods, the repair of the goods, the 
			payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring 
			equivalent goods, or the payment of the cost of having the 
			goods repaired; or
		(ii)	in the case of services, the supplying of the services 
			again, or the payment of the cost of having the services 
			supplied again. 
	  (c)	To the maximum extent permitted by law but despite any other 
		clause in these terms, your use of the Materials is at your own 
		risk and neither we nor Tide are liable to you for any loss or 
		damage you (or any of your representatives or sub-licensees) 
		suffer, sustain or incur in connection with these terms, 
		exercise of any rights granted under these terms or otherwise 
		in connection with any access or use of the Materials, including 
		in respect of any loss, corruption or interception of data or 
		breach of privacy or security.  
	  (d)	Without limiting paragraph (c), to the maximum extent permitted 
		by law, neither we nor Tide are not liable to you for and no 
		measure of damages will under any circumstances include: 
		(i)	special, indirect, consequential, incidental or punitive 
			damages; or
		(ii)	damages for loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, 
			opportunity, anticipated savings or loss or corruption of 
			data.
	  (e)	The exclusions and limitations of liability in this clause 8 
		apply regardless of the basis on which such liability arises, 
		whether in contract, breach of warranty, tort (including 
		negligence), in equity, under statute, under an indemnity or 
		on any other basis.
	  (f)	You will indemnify us and hold us, Tide and each of our 
		directors, officers, employees and contractors harmless from 
		and against any loss suffered or incurred by us or any of 
		those indemnified, arising out of or in connection with: 
		(i)	your or any of your sub-licensee’s access or use of any of 
			the Materials or any other exercise of any of the rights 
			granted to you under these terms in connection with any of 
			the Materials;
		(ii)	your negligence or breach of these terms; 
		(iii)	your violation of any applicable law or infringement of any 
			rights (including Intellectual Property Rights) of a third 
			party; or
		(iv)	any claim made by any third party arising out of or in 
			connection with any Modified Materials, including any 
			application developed using any of the Materials, and 
			including in respect of infringement of any person’s 
			Intellectual Property Rights. 
	8	Termination
	  (a)	Your License to use the Materials under clause 3(a) immediately 
		and automatically terminates without the need for us to give 
		notice to you if you breach these terms.
	  (b)	You may terminate these terms at any time by ceasing all use 
		and removing all implementations of the Materials and the Tide 
		Protocol.
	  (c)	Upon termination of these terms, all rights and Licenses 
		granted to you under these terms will also terminate and you 
		must immediately cease using the Materials and remove all 
		implementations of the Materials. 
	9	General
	  (a)	You remain fully responsible and liable for the acts and 
		omissions of any third party to whom you subcontract the 
		exercise or performance any of your rights or obligations under 
		these terms, as if such acts and omissions were your acts and 
		omissions. 
	  (b)	If any part of these terms is held to be unenforceable, the 
		unenforceable part is to be given effect to the greatest extent 
		possible and the remainder will remain in full force and effect.   
	  (c)	No waiver, delay or failure by us to take any action shall 
		constitute or be construed as a waiver of that or any other term, 
		condition, option, privilege or right we may have.
	  (d)	The word “including” when used in these terms is not a term of 
		limitation.

	End of License terms

	If you develop a Modified Material and want to assert your copyright, 
	attach the following notices to the Modified Material. It is best to 
	attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state 
	the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the 
	“copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
